## ‚ùì What is nextauri ?

Nextauri for now is a small template to generate tauri project with nextjs along typescript and styled-components.
</br>
It doesn't come with linting and other stuff would you like to ?
</br>
But it may become a CLI writen in rust to blazing fastly install any kind of nextjs template with tauri. 

## üé® Developing

To develop with nextauri you need to run 2 commands
One to start nextjs in development mode and one to start tauri in development mode.
It's will enable live reload for both.


1.  First start nextjs in development

    ```sh
    npm run next dev
    ```

2.  Then start tauri in development mode

    ```sh
    npm run tauri dev
    ```

<blockquote>
Note that tauri is waiting for an http server to be alive on localhost:3000

You have to start npm run next dev first.
</blockquote>


## ‚ö°Production


To build nextauri in production mode you can do it in a single command.

```sh
npm run render-all
```

This will build and export nextjs and build tauri for current environement.

## üîß Advanced usage

1.  If you just want render next you can use

    ```sh
    npm run render-next
    ```

2.  If you just want render tauri

    ```sh
    npm run render-tauri
    ```

    Look into `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` to tweak the settings,
    and refer to both nextjs and tauri documentation.
